# Name-Recognition-by-using-NLP

-> Named entities are real-world objects with specific names, such as people, places, organizations, or products.

-> In Machine Learning, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing task focused on identifying these named entities within a given text.While Grammarly corrects spelling and punctuation errors, it does not handle named entities. It uses similar techniques to those employed in NER but does not address entity recognition itself.

# Data Insights:

1.Built a BiLSTM model with Keras for Named Entity Recognition (NER), achieving 90% accuracy using categorical cross-entropy and the Adam optimizer.

2.Leveraged Pandas, NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow, and spaCy for data manipulation, tokenization, and entity labeling with 95% precision.

3.Applied a pre-trained spaCy model to visualize recognized entities, reducing NER processing time by 25%.
