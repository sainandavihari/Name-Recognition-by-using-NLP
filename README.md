# Name-Recognition-by-using-NLP

Named entities are real-world objects with specific names, such as people, places, organizations, or products.

In Machine Learning, Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a Natural Language Processing task focused on identifying these named entities within a given text.

While Grammarly corrects spelling and punctuation errors, it does not handle named entities. It uses similar techniques to those employed in NER but does not address entity recognition itself.
